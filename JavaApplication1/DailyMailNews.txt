 Under normal circumstances, it might have been an opportunity for a bit of boasting about the 'Boris Bounce'. The public finances in February were robust with a small surplus of £0.4bn based upon a sharp uptick in taxes by 3 per cent in response to a recovering economy. Instead, the economy now finds itself on a wartime footing. The Bank of England has torn up all the rules of prudent monetary policy.

In spite of the heavy artillery deployed by central banks, it is proving virtually impossible to halt market gyrations. Share prices in London fell another 4 per cent, the Dow tanked 7 per cent, and Brent crude oil prices touched $25.68, down 10 per cent - its lowest for 17 years.

 The current crash on financial markets feels very different to those of the past. Even though the fallout for ordinary citizens from the 2008 banking crisis devastated incomes, it was not a matter of life and death in the Western democracies. Social safety nets, and the fact that most who live in developed countries enjoy a degree of well-being, meant the gyrations on stock markets made people angry but didn't kill them.
